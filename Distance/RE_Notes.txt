Distance:
	-Boss radius needs to take into account BNpc scale, but Dalamud handles this for us.
	-Player hitring is 0.5y radius.  This varies when mounted, but the specific radius when mounted does not seem to actually affect anything.


Player to Enemy Ranges:
	-The ranges stated by the game for targeted skills are from the edge of the player's hitring to the edge of the enemy's hitring.  This applies to auto attacks too.
	-AoE skills centered on the player unsurprisingly use distance from player center for their stated effect range.
	-Some enemies (only seen so far on striking dummies, but not thoroughly tested) do not get hit by AoE attacks that significantly intersect their hitbox.  The reason for this is unknown.


Player to Player Ranges (PvE):
	-Single Target works like single target damage: Skill range plus your character's hitring radius to character ring.
		-This applies to all beneficial skills tested (Healing, Rescue, Cover, TBN, etc.)
	-AoE healing radius is to ally's center, just like enemy AoEs hitting players.


Player to Player Ranges (PvP):
	-Untested


Enemy to Player Ranges:
	-AoE effects centered on boss use range from boss center to player center.
	-Targeted effects from boss are unclear.  Limited testing did not match ranges in the Action sheet in any meaningful way, but I only checked a couple of bosses.


Player to Trust:
	-Targeted effects use player ring to Trust NPC ring.
	-AoE effects centered on player use Trust NPC center for distance (center to center).


Player to NPC:
	-Interaction distance is 6y from player ring, did not change when mounted on larger mount.


Player to Gathering Node:
	-Interaction distance is 3y from player center to node ring.
	-Dismount distance seems to be 3.5y regardless of player ring size when mounted.


Player to EventObjects:
	-Variable, not well tested.


Misc:
	-Melee autos appear to be 3.1y, not 3?
	-Striking dummies are really weird; targeted skills work at stated range, aoe skills and autos act like their hitring is 0.5y.
		-This only appears to apply to some dummies (Level 50 one at house was like this (BNpc ID 541), level 80 ones at Ondo Cups worked like normal enemies).
		-This actually appears to potentially be due to these striking dummies having the object be raised up off of the ground, so your ground distance is within hit
			hit range, but AoE skills might use actual distance, not the projected distance?  That makes things a mess if so.



Aggro:
	-Aggro range appears to be based on distance from player center to enemy hitring (they're nice, round numbers using this distance).
	-Range to aggro seems to be variably 0.03 - 0.1 yalms less than expected.  It varies by boss, but is consistent for that boss.  Idk if this is distance/position imprecision, y-axis shenanigans, or something else.
	-Enemies might be able to have multiple types of aggro; e8s Shiva, you can get behind the boss, where presumably a true sight aggro cone was not extended a full 360 degrees, and get much closer to her than normal; however, you will pull her if you get close enough even in this "blind spot".
	-It is unknown whether sight-based aggro necessarily has a symmetric sight cone.


Focus Target:
	-Uses alpha on res node to dim when target is beyond targetable range.


Target Cursor Addon:
	-Soft Target Ring Res node is idx 12, doesn't become invisible, but alpha goes to zero when not shown.  Image nodes for it stay full alpha.
	-Focus Target Pip Res node is idx 15.  Res node alpha never changes, but image node alpha (16 and 17) go to zero when not shown.
	-Target Pip Res node is idx 18.  Uses visible flags on image modes.
	-Auto attack indicator is Res node 22.  Uses visible flag on res node.
