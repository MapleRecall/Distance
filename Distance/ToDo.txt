Bugs:
	-Aggro range showed up for a brief moment after killing boss in Levi Ex.  Check for monster dead too when deciding whether to show?
		-Check for player dead too.
		-Maybe make the trigger be boss hp <100%, or ideally just boss unaggro'd and not dead if we can find that.
		-This is more complicated than it looks for wipes, and probably requires director info to get it really right.
		-As-is, this can probably only happen with ReAction automatically restoring your focus target, so it's a pretty low priority bug.
	-Make sure that nameplate nodes use thin text when nameplates use thin text.
	-Try to fix nameplate node initial positions so that they do not jump on first use.


Arbitrary Arcs:
	-Target Aggressive status options.
	-Improve arcs to have radial lines for cones at the appropriate point, and maybe add an option to have those lines and the circle outside of the arc be dotted when not near enough angle to them for the configured arc length to show normally.
	-Make sure that arc calcs/drawing have divide by zero protection and handle negative numbers smaller than target radius gracefully.


Priority:
	-Add text commands for arcs.
	-Improve aggressive/unaggressive detection.
	-Rate limit download attempts.
		-Github does this for us, no?
	-Figure out why aoe tooltip distances are inaccurate on some enemies (i.e., striking dummy).
	-Fix how we decide to set whether to use depth.  Surely there's a way to just get it from the nameplate's text node.
	-Show distances on party list?
	-Add distances to enemy list?
	-Improve the data file format and updater:
		-Make the datafile a CSV or similar so that additional columns can be added easily (i.e., aggro type, sight cone information, etc.)
			-Does .net CSV parser work on Linux/Mac?
			-JSON, etc. out because duplicating the schema for every row is stupid.
		-Make it two files: a data file, and a version file that contains only the version number and a hash of the data file for verification.
			-Allows for only a very small file that's downloaded every time to check version, even if data size balloons.


Cleanup:
	-Config option strings need to be gone over and made consistent.
	-Make nameplate sig(s) optional.
		-Implemented; just needs testing.
	-Skip some node draw setup (like color, position, whatever calculations) if just hiding the node.  Probably doesn't matter that much, but this plugin's gotten a bit heavy.
	-Change BNpcID to BNpcNameID to be more accurate.


Misc:
	-Translations.


Maybe:
	-Add an option to export and import widget/arc configs, but the config options might not be the most stable things ever, so how much of a mess could this end up being?
	-Add icon/text nodes to nameplates to show aggro type(s) and ranges (when available).
	-Add icon nodes for the range type and boss aggro prefix?  Text versions look a bit ugly/busy, and partially don't work with heavy text mode.
		-Could also have other neat icons like the auto attack one (ui/uld/TargetCursor_hr1.tex) that people could attach.
	-Have an alternate drawing method that uses ImGui instead of game UI elements in case people want to hide stuff from capture.
		-Supporting stuff like font options is going to suck; maybe just add it with absolutely minimal support.
	-Provide IPC for others to get aggro data?
		-Also maybe to get the aggro point on line from an enemy.
	-Option to lock aggro widget to the screen-space projection of the aggro point?
	-A text input box to let people format their aggro widget.
		-We need to be really careful to validate the string and allow no format placeholders besides "{0}".
	-Add distance-based coloring to nameplate distances, party distances, etc.?
	-Should make a more encapsulated node (or node controller or something) class before doing the preceeding; it's just getting too much tracking floating nodes with disparate functionality to have even more to do with them.
	-Add friends/fc member conditions for nameplates?
	-Add option to recolor target/focus target/soft target cursors based on distance.
	-Could maybe experiment with using depth-enabled UI nodes to draw arc beneath character?


Rejected:
	-Editor for aggro data?
		-Not worth the effort; just use a spreadsheet.
		-Having to deal with potential re-sorts based on edits would be annoying.
	-Add an ImGui window over the text node and track its position to allow for dragging?
		-Not worth the effort for a very minor convenience that will rarely be used.
	-Maybe add option to use caution/warning aggro colors as a gradient rather than just step color changes.
		-Probably more work than it's worth, and starting to get into real feature bloat.
	-ImGui cursor position seems to lag the game's cursor position, making a mouseover widget get wiggly sometimes.
		-This actually seems to happen with the game's cursor itself and game UI windows.
		-Problem fixed if using software cursor in options, so not our problem really.


A Note on Skill Ranges (stick on wiki and link or something):
	The game uses a few different metrics when determining distances at which skills can be used and hit entities, so please consider the
	following when taking or using distance measurements:
		- For all targeted skills, the skill's range is from the edge of the character's hitring (0.5y from character
			center) to the edge of the enemy's/ally's hitring.  This means that, for example, max melee range from an enemy's hitring is actually 3.5y
			as measured by this plugin, not the 3y stated on the tooltip.  The reason that distances reported by the plugin do not automatically
			take this into account is because it would then incorrectly report distances in terms of AoE skills.
		- For AoE skills that have a radius, the radius is measured from the center of the target.  The target can be yourself (skills like Standard Step, Medica, etc.),
			an enemy (Flare, Akh Morn, etc.), or another player (Cure III).  For an AoE skill to hit an enemy, the edge of their hitring must be within the specific skill's
			radius of the skill target's center.  This is the distance that the plugin measures by default (player center to target hitring).
		-For a beneficial AoE skill to hit another player, their center must be within the specific skill's radius of the target's center.  This means
			that, for example, a party member must be within 14.5y as measured by this plugin to be hit by medica, not the 15y stated on the tooltip.
		-Accordingly, depending on your usage of the plugin, you may or may not wish to apply an offset to measured distances in the plugin settings; however,
			remember that offsetting to make targeted skill ranges match tooltips will make AoE radius off by another half yalm, and vise versa if offsetting
			for AoE healing skills.  This can also be partially aleviated by creating mutliple widgets with different object type filters and ring settings.

		-tl;dr: With default settings, you will be able to hit enemies with single-target skills 0.5y further away than your tooltips say, and will have to be 0.5y closer
				than your tooltips say to AoE heal or buff a party member.
